Bugs:
 [ ] Filter and search behaviour '/' is somewhat confusing
 [ ] Weekly starts shows no data in a blank state mode - when delta is empty.
     The counters for added items might use ts from snapshots
 [ ] Dup rows in delta
 [ ] Scroll state shows bogus info for the main window
 [ ] articles with title "[empty]" panics when trying to open then up
 [ ] adding completely new tag in pocket-web to an article doesn't update it in  pocket-tui after refresh
    tags only from delta file are not being recorded as tags
 [ ] Favouriting one of the latest items wont remove it from the list. After refresh - it will come back
     - favourites in delta got inserted in the list as is
 [ ] f and d are to close to each other - possible to fav article that was planning to delete

ideas:
- tui UI designer
- sync TODO list file with github project (using github actions?)
- read ratatui docs about architecture and philosophy
- study code: https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tgt/tree/main

- tag cloud visualizer (might be fun to do in TUI)
