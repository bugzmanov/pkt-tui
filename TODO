 [x] MEDIUM: Tag editing
 [x] BIG: rss feeds queue
   [ ] non-blocking adding to pocket (the operation is supricingly slow)
   [ ] Optimization: Use HTTP headers like If-Modified-Since or ETag when requesting the feed, to avoid reloading same stuff
 [ ] it should be possible to recotegorize article type
 [ ] Sharing snapshot file via icloud
 [ ] "Bump to top" - old article that i think needs to be read sooner than later
 [.] Figure out design for archived, deleted and favourite
     [x] PDF downloads
        [ ] Better file naming ?
     [x] PDFs title parser
     [ ] Show/hide favourites/archived
       [ ] Status line
     [ ] index for fuzzy searching
     [ ] Local archieve of the actual articles/videos and fuzzy search in archieves
     [ ] VIDEO downloads - integration with yt-dlp
     [ ] Articles downloads
 [ ] Fuzzy search
 [ ] Figure out viewport parameters automatically (instead of current hardcode)
 [ ] Command mode ":" like in vim
     [ ] display modes: don't show favs & reads, show top only, etc
 [ ] Save marks
 [ ] sneaky jumps
 [ ] White papers domains (https://arxiv.org/ https://dl.acm.org/doi/) should mark item type as pdf
    [ ] Downloading those becomes more painful

Tech Dept:
 [ ] Proper exit instead of panic
 [ ] Error handling
 [ ] Logging of http requests/responses
 [ ] Integration tests (oof)
 [ ] Simplify App modes (some of popups represented both as a mode and status in App{})

Low priority:
 [ ] Enable mouse for jumps and copy-pasting
 [ ] /search should jump not filter(maybe)
 [ ] "In-progress" for long running stuff
 [ ] Item stats: video length, article length, PDF pages
 [ ] copy-paste
 [ ] record notes (using nvim)
 [ ] article preview of the article
 [ ] release binaries on github
 [ ] reading/watching time
 [ ] related articles grouping
 [ ] auto-tagging

Bugs:
 [ ] Filter and search behaviour '/' is somewhat confusing
 [ ] Weekly starts shows no data in a blank state mode - when delta is empty.
     The counters for added items might use ts from snapshots
 [ ] Dup rows in delta
 [ ] Scroll state shows bogus info for the main window
 [ ] articles with title "[empty]" panics when trying to open then up
 [ ] adding completely new tag in pocket-web to an article doesn't update it in  pocket-tui after refresh
    tags only from delta file are not being recorded as tags
 [ ] Favouriting one of the latest items wont remove it from the list. After refresh - it will come back
     - favourites in delta got inserted in the list as is
 [ ] f and d are to close to each other - possible to fav article that was planning to delete
 [ ] PDF parsers: Sometimes meta-title contains garbage. meanwhile normal title can and should be parsed from the text:

 [ ]  filter by domain -> drop filter -> the cursor jumps to the beginning of the list

ideas:
- tui UI designer
- sync TODO list file with github project (using github actions?)
- read ratatui docs about architecture and philosophy
- study code: https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tgt/tree/main

- tag cloud visualizer (might be fun to do in TUI)
