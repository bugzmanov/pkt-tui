Bugs:
 [ ] Filter and search behaviour '/' is somewhat confusing
 [ ] Weekly starts shows no data in a blank state mode - when delta is empty.
     The counters for added items might use ts from snapshots
 [ ] Dup rows in delta
 [ ] Scroll state shows bogus info for the main window
 [ ] articles with title "[empty]" panics when trying to open then up
 [ ] adding completely new tag in pocket-web to an article doesn't update it in  pocket-tui after refresh
     (i.e. update is being lost somewhere)

ideas:
- tui UI designer
- replicate pkt-tui as a website (wasm?)
- sync TODO list file with github project (using github actions?)

- study code: https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tgt/tree/main
